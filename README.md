## about —[blog](https://blog.jpramos.me)
[**GitHub**](https://github.com/jpVinnie) if you're a programmer; [**Linkedin**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpv-ramos/) if you need a programmer.

I'm an undergrad student at Cornell University who enjoys programming languages, linguistics, and philosophy —**only if it's analytical**. My —*current and always changing*— favorite areas of study are logic, type theory, category theory, semantics, and software verification.

## recently read on wikipedia 
- [Boolean satisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_satisfiability_problem)
> The problem of determining if there exists an interpretation that satisfies a given Boolean formula. 

- [Qualia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qualia)
> Individual instances of subjective, conscious experience. The term qualia derives from the Latin neuter plural form (qualia) of the Latin adjective quālis (Latin pronunciation: [ˈkʷaːlɪs]) meaning "of what sort" or "of what kind" in a specific instance, such as "what it is like to taste a specific apple — this particular apple now".

- [SKI combinator calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus)
> A combinatory logic system and a computational system. It can be thought of as a computer programming language, though it is not convenient for writing software.
