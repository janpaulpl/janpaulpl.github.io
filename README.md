## about
[My GitHub](https://github.com/jpVinnie) ; more *details* about me over there, but my resume is right [here](https://github.com/jpVinnie/jpVinnie/blob/master/Data/resume.pdf).

I'm an undergrad student at Cornell University who enjoys theoretical computer science and the deep rooted intersection between mathematics and computer science. My favourite areas are number theory, combinatorics, category theory, computational complexity, quantum computing, topology, and language semantics. I don't have any books nor interesting readings to recommend, but you can see my favourite films at [my letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Vinnely/) account. Also [some cool music here](https://bandcamp.com/jpvinnely).

## recently read on wikipedia 
- [Axiomatic semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiomatic_semantics)
> an approach based on mathematical logic for proving the correctness of computer programs. It is closely related to [Hoare logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic).
- [Fixed-point combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed-point_combinator)
> In mathematics and computer science in general, a fixed point of a function is a value that is mapped to itself by the function.
- [Curry-Howard correspondence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry–Howard_correspondence)
> The direct relationship between computer programs and mathematical proofs.
