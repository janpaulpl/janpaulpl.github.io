## about
[My GitHub](https://github.com/jpVinnie) ; more *details* about me over there, but my resume is right [here](https://github.com/jpVinnie/jpVinnie/blob/master/Data/LinkedIn%20Resume.pdf).

I'm an undergrad student at Cornell University who enjoys theoretical computer science and the deep rooted intersection between mathematics and computer science. My favourite areas are number theory, combinatorics, category theory, computational complexity, quantum computing, topology, and language semantics. I don't have any books nor interesting readings to recommend, but you can see my favourite films at [my letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Vinnely/) account. Also [some cool music here](https://bandcamp.com/jpvinnely).

## recently read on wikipedia 
- [Runge's phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon)
>  In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, Runge's phenomenon is a problem of oscillation at the edges of an interval that occurs when using polynomial interpolation with polynomials of high degree over a set of equispaced interpolation points.
- [The Ricky Gervais Show](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ricky_Gervais_Show)
> The Ricky Gervais Show is a comedy radio show in the UK starring Ricky Gervais, Stephen Merchant, and Karl Pilkington, later adapted into a podcast and a television series. Despite being named after the more famous Gervais, it mostly revolves around the life and ideas of Karl Pilkington.
- [Game semantics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_semantics)
> An approach to formal semantics that grounds the concepts of truth or validity on game-theoretic concepts, such as the existence of a winning strategy for a player, somewhat resembling Socratic dialogues or medieval theory of Obligationes.
