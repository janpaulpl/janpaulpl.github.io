## about
[My GitHub](https://github.com/jpVinnie) ; more *details* about me over there, but my resume is right [here](https://github.com/jpVinnie/jpVinnie/blob/master/Data/resume.pdf).

I'm an undergrad student at Cornell University who enjoys theoretical computer science and the deep rooted intersection between mathematics and computer science. My favourite areas are number theory, combinatorics, category theory, computational complexity, quantum computing, topology, and language semantics. I don't have any books nor interesting readings to recommend, but you can see my favourite films at [my letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/Vinnely/) account. Also [some cool music here](https://bandcamp.com/jpvinnely).

## recently read on wikipedia 
- [Cross-linguistic onomatopeias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-linguistic_onomatopoeias)
> Because of the nature of onomatopoeia, there are many words which show a similar pronunciation in the languages of the world.
- [Algebraic data type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type)
> In computer programming, especially functional programming and type theory, an algebraic data type is a kind of composite type, i.e., a type formed by combining other types.
- [Guarded Command Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guarded_Command_Language)
> The Guarded Command Language (GCL) is a language defined by Edsger Dijkstra for predicate transformer semantics. It combines programming concepts in a compact way, before the program is written in some practical programming language. Its simplicity makes proving the correctness of programs easier, using Hoare logic.

## movie of the month
> The 400 Blows *Les Quatre Cents Coups* | 1959 | Dir. François Truffaut | Mus. Jean Constantin

Definitely will have to re-watch this French New Wave classic. Oddly mundane yet still engaging. I really enjoyed the spinning scene. For my more detailed thought process, [check out the blog post](https://notes.jpramos.me/blog/#january-2022-movie-of-the-month---the-400-blows).
