# Thank You

This is a custom adaptation of [Gruvbox theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox){:target="_blank"} based on the Jekyll Minimal theme.

The code highligther color scheme is an adapation of the [VSCode version of Visual Gruvbox (Medium Dark)](https://github.com/rphlmr/visual-gruvbox-medium-dark){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to modify some things, go on the "assets" folder and edit main.scss.
For more modifications, this is on the "_sass" folder.

*There is maybe (for sure) some useless css code. It comes from the base theme*
