# About
I'm a Senior (applying to Doctoral Programs!) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) working towards degrees in [Computer Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/) with a concentration in [Programming Languages](https://pl.cs.cornell.edu/) & [Philosophy](https://philosophy.cornell.edu/) with a concentration in [Logic advised by Dr. Harold T. Hodes](https://philosophy.cornell.edu/harold-theodore-hodes).

My main research interests involve developing practical frameworks for specifying program behaviors and using automated theorem provers to guarantee such specifications via behaviorally-sound type systems. You can find my [research statement here!](https://janpaul.pl/assets/pdfs/research_stmt.pdf)

## Research

This summer, I'm working with [Dr. Alwyn Goodloe](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/aeg/) at the [Langley Formal Methods research program at NASA](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/index.html). We're mechanizing proofs with Coq that model correct behaviors behind a _well-typed_ implementation of a Software Defined Delay-Tolerant Network's Match-Action pipeline algorithm for NASA’s Interplanetary Overlay Network framework. The well-typedness of the algorithm comes from it being implemented in our _NetQIR_ DSL.

Before that, I worked under [Dr. Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) at CMU thanks to the [REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/Research/index.html) program. We developed a [Gradual Verifier](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/vmcai2018-gradual-verification.pdf) which serves to bridge the gap between static and dynamic verification, by allowing incremental verification of a program. I've worked on the first ever gradual verification tool -- [Gradual C0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02428) -- and gradual verification in [blockchain programming languages](https://popl24.sigplan.org/details/prisc-2024-papers/2/Gradual-Verification-for-Smart-Contracts).

And even before *that*, I started doing Computer Science research under [Dr. Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [Calyx project](https://calyxir.org/). We studied optimizations and extensions towards a compiler infrastructure to simplify encoding of high-level program semantics to lower-level synthesizable hardware designs.

## Community

Outside of Cornell, I'm part of the Audio/Visual team for [SIGPLAN conferences](https://www.sigplan.org/Conferences/). While this is just volunteering work, I've come to put a considerable amount of time into it, so please check out the [SIGPLAN YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@acmsigplan) if you're interested in some cool PL videos!
