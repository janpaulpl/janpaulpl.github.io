# Education
Ciao! I'm a Junior at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) working towards degrees in [Computer Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/) & [Philosophy](https://philosophy.cornell.edu/). I started doing Computer Science research under [Dr. Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [Calyx project](https://calyxir.org/). We studied optimizations and extensions towards a compiler infrastructure to simplify encoding of high-level program semantics to lower-level synthesizable hardware designs.

My main research interests involve developing **practical tools** for software verification using both formal & lightweight methods. 

# Current Research
Since the summer of 2022, I've been working under CMU's [REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/Research/index.html) program with [Dr. Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/). We've been working on a [Gradual Verifier](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/vmcai2018-gradual-verification.pdf) which serves to bridge the gap between static and dynamic verification, by allowing incremental verification of a program. 

My work under the Gradual Verification framework involves optimizing and [verifying the soundness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIIwmw0z2Yg) of the first ever gradual verification tool -- [Gradual C0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02428) -- and bringing gradual verification to the domain of [blockchain programming languages](https://github.com/gradual-verification/gradual-TEAL).
