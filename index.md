# About
I'm a Senior (applying to Doctoral Programs!) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/) working towards degrees in [Computer Science](https://cis.cornell.edu/) with a concentration in [Programming Languages](https://pl.cs.cornell.edu/) & [Philosophy](https://philosophy.cornell.edu/) with a concentration in [Logic advised by Dr. Harold T. Hodes](https://philosophy.cornell.edu/harold-theodore-hodes).

My main research interest involves developing practical frameworks for program verification by creating a set of _canonical_ and _reusable_ representations for domain-specific programs to ease the need to directly mechanize code with automated theorem provers. You can find my [research statement here!](https://janpaul.pl/assets/pdfs/research_stmt.pdf)

## Research

I'm currenty working with [Dr. Alwyn Goodloe](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/people/aeg/) at [NASA's Langley Formal Methods](https://shemesh.larc.nasa.gov/fm/index.html). We're mechanizing proofs with Coq that model correct behaviors behind a _well-behaved_ implementation of a Software Defined Delay-Tolerant Network's Match-Action pipeline algorithm for NASA’s Interplanetary Overlay Network framework. The well-behavedness of the algorithm comes from it being implemented in our networks DSL: _NetQIR_ !

I'm also working with [Dr. Adrian Sampson](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asampson/) in the [Calyx project](https://calyxir.org/). Here, I'm figuring out how to model hardware-level parallelism using Kleene Algebra with Tests.

In addition, I'm a 2× [CMU REUSE](https://www.cmu.edu/scs/s3d/reuse/Research/index.html) alumni. I worked under [Dr. Jonathan Aldrich](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) in developing a [Gradual Verifier](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/vmcai2018-gradual-verification.pdf), seeking to bridge the gap between static and dynamic verification. I worked on the first ever gradual verification tool -- [Gradual C0](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02428) -- and made use of gradual verification for [blockchain programming languages](https://popl24.sigplan.org/details/prisc-2024-papers/2/Gradual-Verification-for-Smart-Contracts).

## Community

Outside of Cornell, I'm part of the Audio/Visual team for [SIGPLAN conferences](https://www.sigplan.org/AV). While this is just volunteering work, I've come to put a considerable amount of time into it, so feel free check out [SIGPLAN's official YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@acmsigplan) if you're interested in some cool PL videos!
